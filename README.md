## :rocket: Deployment in Heroku

### 1. Login to Heroku

Log in using the Heroku CLI:

```bash
heroku login
```

### 2. Create a Heroku App
   
Create a new Heroku application:

```bash
heroku create
```

### 3. Add a Procfile
   
Ensure your project includes a Procfile with the following content:

```bash
web: ruby Holamundo.rb -o 0.0.0.0
```

This ensures Heroku knows how to start your application.

### 4. Add a Ruby Buildpack
